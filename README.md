APIs Scalability:

Implement Caching: Implementing cache controls allows clients to store responses and reuse them, reducing the load on your server. Cache headers like ETag and Last-Modified can be used to validate if the cached response is still fresh, while Cache-Control and Expires dictate how long the response can be cached.
Use a Load Balancer: As traffic grows, a single server may struggle to keep up. That's where load balancers come in. They distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. This increases your REST API's capacity to handle requests.
Optimize Database Interactions: Unoptimized database queries can be a bottleneck for scaling. Index your database properly, avoid N+1 query problems, and use pagination to limit the amount of data returned in a single request.
Rate Limiting: While it seems counterintuitive, rate limiting can actually improve scalability. By limiting the number of requests a single client can make in a specific timeframe, you prevent overloading your servers and maintain a quality service for all users.
